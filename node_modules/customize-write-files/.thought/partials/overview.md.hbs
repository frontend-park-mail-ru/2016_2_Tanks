The {{npm 'customize'}} module is a framework for creating overridable configurations for different
engines. It is, in principle, designed to be platform independent (that's actually only half-true).
Engines running in `customize` always return file-contents as JavaScript-object in the form

```js
{
  'engineName': {
    'file.txt': 'contents of the file',
    'subdir/file.txt': 'contents of the other file'
  }
```

The contents of the file may be one of the following

* A string (to be stored in the file `utf-8`-encoded) 
* A buffer
* A readable stream.

The goal of `{{name}}` is to act as an NodeJS-adapter for customize 
and store the result of `customize` in a local directory structure.
